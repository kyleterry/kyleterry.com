This post you are reading was generated with
[Solarwind](https://github.com/kyleterry/solarwind). It's a small program
written in Go that will compile markdown and html templates into your static
site (nothing but html and static assets).

This is nothing new. There are dozens of these. I only did this because they are
all terribly bloated and it was hard to do anything simple. I won't name drop
here, but it actually took me less time to write my own in Go, than it did to
setup and get a site generated in one of the more popular SSGs.

This is sad.

Checkout my project and leave me some github issues if you find anything wrong
or missing. It's about 15 hours old at the time of this writing, so there's
going to be something broken.
