                        <h3>Copious, Inc <small>Senior Systems Engineer</small></h3>
                        <p><em>Portland, OR &middot; May 2013 - Present</em></p>
			<p>Handling devops, systems administration and systems engineering. I use tools across the whole technology spectrum including, but not limited to, Bash, Redis, PERL, Linux, PHP, Python, Citrix, Ruby, Networking tools, and others to deploy, manage and scale application stacks.</p>
			<p>Scaling, engineering and maintaining Zumiez.com on the systems side. Making the most of our bare-metal hardware by tuning, optimizing and planning ahead (but not too far ahead :)).</p>
                        <h3>Aquameta, LLC <small>Backend Software Engineer</small></h3>
                        <p><em>Portland, OR &middot; August 2010 - June 2013</em></p>
                        <p>Designing and engineering web based warehouse software in Python using Django, Postgresql, Redis and other modern web technologies. I was responsible for bringing in the Redis Key/Value database for use in caching and message queuing. The data in the software is extremely real-time and used in a fast paced working environment, so optimizing and creating deadly accurate functions and algorithms is essential to the client. Other tasks are devops and systems admin work in a Linux environment. I assist the full time systems administrators in setting up the internal network and VPN, the warehouse network, bare-metal servers, and co- designed a software stack aimed at efficiently serving the warehouse software. The whole company runs its network and software on self-hosted virtual Linux servers. I helped build and allocate resources to the bare-metal servers that host our VMs.</p>
                        <p>Innovation is a big part of the company and I am present for weekly innovation training meetings and regularly attend the design process behind new application ideas. The team and I frequently meet to design schemas and back-ends for the warehouse software and various other pieces of innovation.</p>

                        <h3>Pamiris, Inc <small>Software Engineer</small></h3>
                        <p><em>Portland, OR &middot; November 2008 - May 2010</em></p>
                        <p>Engineered web based payroll software in PHP using a custom built framework and ORM, and MySQL. Everything was in a Linux environment. Attention to detail was crucial because the application did everything from track employee's time to generating paychecks, deducting taxes, and generating W-2s.</p>
                        <p>I also created numerous tools for handling day to day tasks that could be automated in Python, bash and PHP. One tool includes a database management helper that encrypted incremental backups all day long and transferred them to a redundant backup server.</p>

                        <h3>GemsTV USA <small>Linux Systems Administration, Helpdesk, Software Development</small></h3>
                        <p><em>Reno, NV &middot; February 2007 - November 2008</em></p>
                        <p>Started at the company as a helpdesk technician assisting the call center and warehouse with various issues they would have with computers. Not long after starting, I took on a more important roll of being an on-hand Linux systems administrator. I would manage and maintain servers that included a large cluster of CentOS and Debian web servers, a pair of Debian load balancers, a pair of Redhat Oracle Nodes, Cisco switches and routers, and a cluster of Avaya phone swiches. I built tools in bash, Python, PHP, and C to help assist with systems administration tasks.</p>
                        <p>I also designed new procedures and systems that were being implemented in the company. I installed new servers and I was responsible for making important decisions on how they were setup. I coordinated with the other IT team members to get this done in the best way possible.</p>

                        <h3>Moondog Computers <small>Computer Repair Tech.</small></h3>
                        <p><em>Reno, NV &middot; 2005 - 2006</em></p>
                        <p>Repaired desktop and server computers for consumers and business customers. I helped customers design the perfect computer for their needs. I built literally thousands of personal and business desktops. I also repaired and replaced laptop DC jacks.</p>

                        <h3>Paragon Products <small>Repair Tech.</small></h3>
                        <p><em>El Dorado Hills, CA &middot; 2005 - 2006</em></p>
                        <p>Repaired and restored locomotive and marine fuel pumps. I helped the electronics engineers build and repair DC power inverters and logic boards.</p>
